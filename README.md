## ii) Member Contributions:

````
Set up project with given code (John Salinas, JohnSalinas123)
  => set up datastructures that will be used
  => set up utility methods for graph class
````

### Adjacency matrix version
````
Implement: Create the graph shown in Task 1 instructions (Name goes here)
````

````
Implement: breadth-first traversal algorithm (Name goes here)
  => traversal begins at node labeled A
````

````
Implement: Create graph shown in Task 2 instructions (Name goes here)
````

````
Implement: Iterative algorithm that performs depth-first traveral of graph (Name goes here)
  => using a stack for your iterative algorithm (don't use recursive method)
````

### Adjacency list version

````
Work in progress!
